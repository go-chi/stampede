- [ ] Review options.. ie. 
    - [ ] WithCacheKeyRequestBody
    - [ ] what else..?

- [ ] lets add another workspace where we do e2e tests with chi, cachestore-mem, etc.
      this way just go-chi/stampede package can be very lightweight for its go.mod

- [ ] vary header support, which will adjust cache key too, and singleflight key.. etc.
